List of issues I have fixed and what worked:

LANGUAGE ========================================================================================================

1.
PROBLEM: german and hungarian languages toggle just fine, but when I click on the english translation it does not work.
FIX: 
I swapped   window.location.href = newPath; with await router.push(newPath); 
WHY THIS WORKED:
The previous command reloads the entire page which resets the application state and "breaks" the page so the translations didn't work.

2.
PROBLEM: when I translate a page, and than switch to another subpage, the lanaguage resets 
FIX: added useLocalePath to the code.

3.
PROBLEM: The tab path in default.vue stopped working after adding language translation.
FIX: updated the locale path again.

4. 
PROBLEM: Nuxt is trying to find my .json files for language locales inside /i18n/locales/
FIX: Updated the nuxt.config.ts langDir to ../locales
